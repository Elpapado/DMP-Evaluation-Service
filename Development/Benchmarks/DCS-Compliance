  **Tests**
- id: validate_dcs_json_schema
description: "Validates the maDMP against the latest official DMP Common Standard JSON Schema."
input: ".json maDMP"
output: "pass/fail"

- id: check_dcs_cardinality
description: >
      Verifies presence of required, optional, and extension fields as defined in the DMP Common Standard specification.
      This includes checking that required fields are not missing and that optional and extension fields are correctly structured if present.
input: ".json maDMP"
output: "pass/fail"

- id: check_dcs_data_types
description: >
      Checks that field values conform to expected data types and value constraints defined in the DMP Common Standard.
      Examples include date formats (e.g., ISO 8601), use of controlled vocabularies, and valid enumerations.
input: ".json maDMP"
output: "pass/fail"
