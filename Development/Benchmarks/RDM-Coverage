title: "Comprehensive RDM Activities Coverage"
  narrative: >
    Ensure that the DMP addresses all key components of research data management,
    including lifecycle coverage, roles and responsibilities, budgeting, description
    of outputs, provenance, application of best practices, reproducibility, and
    alignment with relevant policies.
